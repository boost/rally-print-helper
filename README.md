Rally Print Helper
=========================

## Overview
This app utilizes the print driver on your computer to dictate the size. It is based around using Iterations to print specific cards, though it does give you access to the backlog. The cards fill an A4 page in Landscape mode. To print 4 to a page fit 4 pages to a page in your print options and the stories will auto size to fit.

## Things to come
- ~~RANK & SIZE numbers better labeled and sized~~
- ~~Iteration Dropdown order by latest first~~
- ~~Lock sort on Columns (forcing sort by rank)~~
- ~~Disabled print button when nothing is selected~~
- Printing defects and defect suites

## Yet to come
- Card Builder

## DONE
